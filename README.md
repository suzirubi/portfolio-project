## Description

The instructions for contents of this project were as follows, with my additions noted in italics:

1. My name. _Used my graphic design business name on home page as one of my goals is to develop a comprehensive website and blog. My full name is listed on the about page, contact page and in the footer._
2. An image of you or something that represents who you are. _About page includes pictures of me, my full name and information about me not related to my business._
3. A list of projects you have created with active links to them (either on GitHub or GitHub pages). _Home page has projects I have created for my business along with an active link on the home page to a website I created that is still active. Home page has a bucket with quick links for Epicodus projects. The [repository listing in github] (https://github.com/suzirubi?tab=repositories) has complete descriptions and README.md files for each project completed in the Intro to Programming first week. _
4. For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses. _All of the epicodus project repositories this information. Here is the link to the [repository listing in github] (https://github.com/suzirubi?tab=repositories) with complete descriptions and README.md files for each project completed in the Intro to Programming first week._

## Known Bugs

_Oh boy, where do I start? The biggest bug was the first folder I worked on. Somehow I deleted everything, I'm not sure if it was the extra branches I made to test index.html page, the way i named gh_pages incorrectly. I made the mistake of deleting the repository then POOOF! everything was messed up. I'm making a copy of the portfolioFix file before I do the gh-pages this time._
