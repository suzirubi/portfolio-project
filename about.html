          <p>suzirubi is a nickname a former boss at nike gave me many years ago. Suzi Rubino is my real name and I was born and raised in Oregon. Finished college down in San Francisco and started working at Sunset Magazine. When my first child was born I moved back to Oregon to have a little space and money. A more formal resume is up at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzi-rubino-3826993">linked in</a>. I found my passion in my early forties, climbing, by joining a 100-year-old climbing club here in Oregon: the <a href="http://mazamas.org/">Mazamas</a>. After taking almost all of their classes (haven't done advanced snow and ice yet) I've become a hike leader and assisted with many climbing classes.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://www.biography.com/people/groups/born-1959">A long, long time ago...</a></h4>
          <p>In 1966, our family traveled to Wyoming to visit the fantastic parks there. This picture was taken at Jenny Lake, near the base of 13,770 foot tall Grand Teton.</p>

          <p>We were lucky... the ice melted on the route we climbed. It still took us a long time and we didn't make it back to base camp until dark. Our base camp was at 11,000 feet right below a saddle where the wind just ripped across the boulders.</p>
